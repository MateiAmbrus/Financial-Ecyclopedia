                    <h2>Banks</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are two types of banks. Commercial banks and investment banks.
                        In this section we'll talk about commercial banks. Commercial banks are
                        responsable with three main things: deposits, credits and transactions.
                        People who have money or want a save place to deposit money go to the bank to
                        make a savings account. This account offers the depositor an interest rate.
                        On the other hand people who don't have money go to the bank to take out a loan
                        or to take a credit. This credit also has an interest rate only this time it does not
                        go to the one who holds the loan but to the bank. The difference between the money that comes
                        into the bank from loans (credits) and the money that comes out of the bank to its depositors
                        is the amout of money that the bank gets to keep for its service.
                        Now that we have explained how a commercial bank works let's talk about the most common
                        deposit accounts and loans that a commercial bank offers.

                <h2>Insurance</h2>
                    <p>
                    An insurance contract is a contract that allows you to delegate some of 
                    your financial risk to a specialised institution called an insurer. When we 
                    talk about insurance we firt need to talk about risk. Every risk that an 
                    insurer can insure must be: random, homogenos (happens to many people) and 
                    can be financially estimated. This is why insurance companies don't cover all
                    risks that can exist. For example the reason that commodities futures markets 
                    exist is because insurance companies are not willing to insure against price risk
                    wich is imesurable or infinite, but more on that later. An insurance contract has 
                    three main players: the insurer, the insured and the beneficiary. The insurer is 
                    obligated to pay a montly fee for the risk specified in the contract and the beneficiary
                    will recieve de ammount specified in the contract. The beneficiary can be either the insured 
                    or a third party.Now that we have discussed how insurance contract work let's see what are some of the 
                    most common insurance products

                    <h2>Investments</h2>
                    <p>
                        Investments are financial instruments that can be bought or sold on the 
                    financial markets. Investments are usually broken down into two groups.
                    speculative and non-speculative. Speculative investments are investments
                    with a high degree of risk. Another aspect of speculative investments is 
                    that they tipically don't have an expiration date they can be held of 
                    forever. In this category of investments we include stocks, commodities,
                    normal courencies and crypto courencies.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                    Stocks are pieces of companies traded of stock exchanges. If you go on NYSE 
                    ( New York Stock Exchange ) you can buy shares (small pieces) in companies such as Nike, McDonalds, Ford, and 
                    others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Commodities are raw materials used in production. You can speculate 
                    on their price if you want to. Some of the most common commodities are oil,
                    coffee, cotton, rice, corn, grain and others. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Normal courencies are courencies
                    such as the dollar, euro, pound, yen and others. You can speculate on the price 
                    fluctuations of one courency against another. If you think the dollar will go up
                    and the euro will go down you can make a profit on that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Crypto currencies are 
                    digital currencies that are usually used for anonimous transactions they. I won't 
                    into detail here because it is a very vast subject but note this out of all the speculative 
                    investments mentioned this is the most volatile (it goes up and down alot).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Non speculative investments are corporate bonds and state bonds. A bond is contract
                    where an investor gives money to a company or the state of a country and in return recieves
                    the promise that at the a specified date you will recieve your money back plus interest.
                    Bonds of companies that are in financial turmoil have a higher yield while bonds of companies
                    that are in good financial shape have low yield. That is why gouvernment bonds have the lowest
                    yield. The chances that a gouvernment will declare bencruptcy are almost zere (Attention I said 
                    almost not complete zero. Because some countries did default on their debt)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The majour recomandation when it comes to investments is to diversify. Putting all your eggs in one
                    basket is a risky move. But by diversifying over a group of common stocks your risk of loosing money
                    is much smaller. Also a portofolio structure of 60% stocks and 40% bonds is considered very sound. When it companies
                    to currencies, crypto and commodities, gamble at your own risk. Also one thing to note is this: Try to avoid
                    leverage/margin buying as much is possible. Leverage or margin buying is the activity of getting into debt
                    to buy stocks, bonds, crypto or any other financial instrument or investment.

                    <h2>Real-estate</h2>
                    <p>
                    Now real-estate can often be seen as just an investment. But, because this is such a special investment
                    I decided to give it it's special segment. You can invest in real-estate trough the stock market (with an instrument called reit)
                    where you buy a piece of land or real-estate or you can invest in the real-estate market by buying houses and/or land. The biggest
                    advantage or dissadvantage of real-estate is leverage. What is that? It is the simple act of buying an asset with debt and then reselling
                    that asset at a much higher profit than if you'd have just bought the property out right. Flipping houses is one option but you can also
                    make your houses generate cash flow (generate a stream of money for you) with rentals, for stay or for events. A flip is hard to pull of
                    because it requiers a good understanding of making renovations. But if you like doing such things you can profit big time buy buying a 
                    bad property for cheep, renovating it, and then selling it for a big profit.

                <p>
                    As a financial institution the state takes money from us trough taxes and, in theory, we recieve public services like 
                    public transport, policing, fire protection (firefighters), law and order and so on. No matter your political inclinations
                    it is better to be practical and make sure that you get to keep as much of your ernings as possible. That is why you should
                    know what are the biggest taxes that you have to pay and wich of those taxes can be legally avoided. There are many types of taxes
                    but in my small list I will enumerate only the most common ones.
